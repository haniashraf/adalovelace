			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
				The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of
				Lovelace—better known as "Ada Lovelace"—was born in London on December
				10, 1815. Ada showed her gift for mathematics at an early age. She
				translated an article on an invention by Charles Babbage, and added her
				own comments. Because she introduced many computer concepts, Ada is
				considered the first computer programmer. Ada died on November 27, 1852.

			<h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p>
				Ada Lovelace, born as Augusta Ada Byron, was the only legitimate child
				of the famous poet Lord George Gordon Byron. Lord Byron's marriage to
				Ada's mother, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron, was not a happy one.
				Lady Byron separated from her husband only weeks after their daughter
				was born. A few months later, Lord Byron left England, and Ada never saw
				her father again. He died in Greece when Ada was 8 years old. Ada had an
				unusual upbringing for an aristocratic girl in the mid-1800s. At her
				mother's insistence, tutors taught her mathematics and science. Such
				challenging subjects were not standard fare for women at the time, but
				her mother believed that engaging in rigorous studies would prevent
				Lovelace from developing her father's moody and unpredictable
				temperament. Ada was also forced to lie still for extended periods of
				time because her mother believed it would help her develop self-control.

			<h2>Work</h2>
			<p>
				Throughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific
				developments and fads of the day, including phrenology and mesmerism. 
				her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. Ada
				was fascinated by Babbage's ideas. Known as the father of the computer,
				he invented the difference engine, which was meant to perform
				mathematical calculations. Ada got a chance to look at the machine
				before it was finished, and was captivated by it. Babbage also created
				plans for another device known as the analytical engine, designed to
				handle more complex calculations. Ada was later asked to translate an
				article on Babbage's analytical engine that had been written by Italian
				engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She not only
				translated the original French text into English, but also added her own
				thoughts and ideas on the machine. Her notes ended up being three times
				longer than the original article. Her work was published in 1843, in an
				English science journal. Ada used only the initials "A.A.L.," for
				Augusta Ada Lovelace, in the publication. In her notes, Ada described
				how codes could be created for the device to handle letters and symbols
				along with numbers. She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat
				a series of instructions, a process known as looping that computer
				programs use today. Ada also offered up other forward-thinking concepts
				in the article. For her work, Ada is often considered to be the first
				computer programmer.

				<h2>Personal Life</h2>
				<p>
					In 1835, Ada married William King, who became the Earl of Lovelace
					three years later. She then took the title of Countess of Lovelace.
					They shared a love of horses and had three children together. From
					most accounts, he supported his wife's academic endeavors. Ada and her
					husband socialized with many of the interesting minds of the times,
					including scientist Michael Faraday and writer Charles Dickens. Ada's
					health suffered, however, after a bout of cholera in 1837. She had
					lingering problems with asthma and her digestive system. Doctors gave
					her painkillers, such as laudanum and opium, and her personality began
					to change. She reportedly experienced mood swings and hallucinations.

				<h2>Legacy</h2>
				<p>
					Ada Lovelace's contributions to the field of computer science were not
					discovered until the 1950s. Her notes were reintroduced to the world
					by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in Faster Than Thought: A
					Symposium on Digital Computing Machines in 1953. Since then, Ada has
					received many posthumous honors for her work. In 1980, the U.S.
					Department of Defense named a newly developed computer language "Ada,"
					after Lovelace.
